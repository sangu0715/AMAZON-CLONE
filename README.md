# AMAZON-CLONE

Project Goal:
The objective of this project was to develop a fully responsive e-commerce website resembling Amazon, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that mimics an online shopping experience, featuring product listings, a shopping cart, and interactive UI components.

Development Process:
The project was built using HTML for structuring the web pages, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactive elements such as cart functionality, product filtering, and dynamic content updates. The layout was designed with a modern, clean UI, ensuring smooth navigation and accessibility across different devices.

Key Features:
1)Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless shopping experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
2)Product Listings: Displays various products with images, prices, and descriptions.
3)Shopping Cart Functionality: Users can add/remove items and view total prices dynamically.
4)Search and Filter Options: Allows users to quickly find desired products.
5)User Authentication (Optional): Basic login/logout system for personalized shopping experience.
